You can chose to don't place 42 header in .cpp and .hpp files from the settings

It can be activated by:
- ctrl + shift + h : Inserts the header only in the currently open file

**Note:** The `Updated` timestamp in the header reflects the time when the header was last placed and not when the code has been modified last time.
